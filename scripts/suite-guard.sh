# Integration-suite completeness guard — issue #137 (server) generalized to
# every crate by issue #141. The filesystem is the truth, the justfile is the
# claim: every crates/*/tests/*.rs must sit in an execution lane, or the run
# that forgot it goes red here instead of the suite silently never running
# (the walgit-cli ci_e2e/collab_e2e orphanage #140's audit found on disk).
#
# Lanes (all defined once, in the justfile; both CI legs consume them):
#   walgit-server  SERVER_TESTS, run by test-server-integration
#   walgit-cli     CLI_TESTS, run by test-cli (ubuntu only — seams at CLI_TESTS)
#   everything else  WILDCARD_TEST_PKGS, run by test-wildcard-crates: the whole
#                  tests/ directory is the lane, a new file runs the moment it
#                  is committed
# Non-suite files (shared modules, tiers with their own recipes) are named in
# the crate's *_TEST_EXEMPT — explicit, but read by this script, never a
# second copy of anything.
#
# The checks, and the failure each exists to catch:
#   ① every file in the truth set is in a lane                (new unregistered
#                                                             suite goes red)
#   ② a glob that matches nothing, an empty lane variable    (#140's vacuous-
#                                                             pass fix: green
#                                                             because there was
#                                                             nothing to see)
#   ③ the *_TESTS / PKGS variables are actually interpolated whole-line by the
#      recipes they claim to feed — a `{{tN}}` prefix glued in front of the
#      cargo line is the windows hazard those recipes' comments warn about, so
#      the match is anchored to the whole line, #140 style.
